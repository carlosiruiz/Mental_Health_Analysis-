# Mental Health in the Tech Industry

**Authors**: Ignacio Ruiz, Justin Williams

## Overview

A one-paragraph overview of the project, including the business problem, data, methods, results and recommendations.

Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI) is a non-profit, 501(c)(3) corporation dedicated to raising awareness and educating others about mental illness. They provide resources to support mental wellness in the tech and open source communitees. A dataset from a OSMI survey conducted primariliy in 2014, was procured via kaggle and utilized for our analysis. Our research question was:

_"Do you believe discussing mental health illness with your employer could have negative consequences?"_

Essentially, we wanted to know what variables would lead to folks answering _Yes_ or _No_ to the aforementioned. We utilized binary classification to train several machine learning models on the dataset. Our main takeaways were respondents knowledge of _benefits_ package, comfortability with _supervisor_ and _interference_ of mental illness with work, were the primary indicators of an answer of _Yes_ to the target variable. Our reccomendations are:

## Business Problem

Summary of the business problem you are trying to solve, and the data questions that you plan to answer in order to solve them.

With tech jobs increasing exponentially, mental health within the tech industry continious to be a salient topic. According to [OSMI](https://osmihelp.org/about/about-osmi), the stigma and the way we talk about mental illness in general, and specifically within the tech industry, needs to change in order for those suffering to have the optimal environment to recover. Therefore, we chose _"Do you believe discussing mental health illness with your employer could have negative consequences_" as a target variable for this analysis. We hypothesized that if an employee felt discussing a mental health issue with their employer could lead to negative consequences, this would indicate a poor environment for those suffering to recover. Therefore, tech employers looking to improve their workplace environments for those with mental health illness, could take the reccomendations provided from this analysis to make long term sustainable changes to their structures.
